## Productivity Skills Deployment

**Date:** 2026-02-18 11:35 AM  
**Phase:** 2.1 (Skill Deployment)  
**Status:** ✅ DAY 1 COMPLETE

---

## ✅ ACCOMPLISHED TODAY

### 1. Cost Tracking Enabled ✅
**Action:** Modified openclaw.json
```json
"commands": {
  "responseUsage": "cost"
}
```
**Gateway:** Restarted successfully (11:14 AM)
**Result:** Cost information will now appear in response footers

### 2. Baseline Metrics Established ✅
**Created:** COST_BASELINE.md
- Session metrics documented
- Current cost: $0.00 (NVIDIA models are FREE)
- Projected daily cost: $0-2/day
- Context usage: 74% (optimal)

### 3. Context Analysis Complete ✅
**Created:** CONTEXT_ANALYSIS.md
- Current context: 147k/200k (74%)
- Bootstrap files: All healthy (<20K chars limit)
- Optimization potential: 30-60% documented

### 4. Persistent Memory Initiated ✅
**Created:** USERS_PRESFERENCES.md
- User preferences stored in workspace
- System preferences documented
- Persistent memory ready for agent army

### 5. Research-Based Deployment Guide ✅
**Created:** PRODUCTIVITY_DEPLOYMENT.md
- 6 trusted sources validated
- Top 10 proven skills documented
- **agent-memory confirmed available**

### 6. MEMORY.md Updated ✅
- Added current session log
- Recorded Phase 2 progress
- Documented optimization milestone

## 📊 KEY FINDINGS

### Bootstrap File Analysis

| File | Characters | Size Limit | Status | Action |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| AGENTS.md | 7,689 | 20,000 | ✅ Healthy | None |
| MEMORY.md | 12,386 | 150,000 | ✅ Healthy | Monitor size |
| OTHER FILES | <10,000 total | 20,000 | ✅ Healthy | None |

**Result:** No optimization needed for bootstrap files at this time.

### Skill Status
