## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

### Speed Metrics:
1. **Model Response Time** - Track each model's speed
2. **Selection Accuracy** - Right model for right task?
3. **Context Optimization** - Minimize token waste

### Quality Metrics:
1. **Accuracy Rate** - Verify information before acting
2. **Resolution Success** - Problems solved vs escalated
3. **User Satisfaction** - Track completion quality

### Cost Metrics:
1. **Free Model Usage** - Prioritize free (NVIDIA)
2. **Token Efficiency** - Maximize information per token
3. **Resource Utilization** - Distribute load optimally

### Growth Metrics:
1. **Skills Learned** - New skills acquired
2. **Patterns Recognized** - Patterns identified
3. **Automations Created** - Tasks automated

## 🎯 Optimization Priority Matrix

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do Now):
1. ✅ Enable reasoning mode
2. ✅ Activate HEARTBEAT.md
3. ✅ Create IDENTITY.md
4. ✅ Build AGENT_ARMY_KNOWLEDGE.md

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do Soon):
1. Set up skills auto-discovery
2. Create shared memory protocol
3. Implement agent performance monitoring
4. Build automated testing framework

### LOW PRIORITY (Do Later):
1. Advanced agent orchestration
2. Multi-agent collaboration workflows
3. Predictive task routing
4. Self-healing protocols

## 🚀 Continuous Improvement Actions

### Every 4 Hours:
- Check context window usage
- Verify APIs are responsive
- Review recent task patterns

### Every Day:
