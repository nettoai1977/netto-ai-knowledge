## 💡 TODAY'S RECOMMENDATION

**Focus: Agent Testing Completion**

Yesterday's wins set up a strong foundation. Today, close the loop on the agent testing framework. With 5 agents pending (Titan, Coder, Max, Spark, Vision), run sequential tests to avoid rate limits. Once complete, update documentation and move to Phase 6: Multi-Agent Collaboration.

**Optimal Flow:** Run one test → Document results → Next test. Target: 100% agent coverage by EOD.
