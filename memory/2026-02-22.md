# 2026-02-22 - Trading Session Summary

## 🎯 Major Milestone: Multi-Timeframe Market Matrix Deployed

### System Architecture
- **4 Automated Cron Jobs:** Daily (7AM), 4H, 1H, 15m scanners
- **CCXT Integration:** Live data from Binance (anti-hallucination)
- **Radar Agent:** Data verification layer
- **Binance Testnet:** Direct API execution (bypasses CCXT deprecation)

### Paper Trading Performance
| Trade | Pair | Side | Entry | Peak PnL | Status |
|-------|------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| TRD-001 | ADA/USDT | SHORT | $0.2798 | +1.75% | Open |
| TRD-002 | AVAX/USDT | SHORT | $9.105 | +1.55% | Open |
| TRD-003 | LINK/USDT | SHORT | $8.843 | +0.41% | Open |

**Total Unrealized PnL: +$4.41 - $6.32 range**

### Technical Achievements
1. Created `market-matrix.js` (29KB) - Main scanner
2. Created `paper_executor.js` v2.0 - Binance Testnet integration
3. Created `binance_api.py` - Direct API wrapper
4. Created `Trinity_ML_Log.md` - ML reflection system
5. Created `AGENT_PERSONAS.md` - 11 agent personalities

### Issues Identified
- TP/SL orders not attached to market orders (manual close needed)
- Discord channel creation requires guildId
- CCXT deprecated Binance Testnet for futures

### Lessons Learned
- Always verify CCXT feature support before implementation
- Direct API calls more reliable than library abstractions
- Paper trading needs TP/SL order attachment at execution

### Session Stats
- **Duration:** ~9 hours (10:04 AM - 7:52 PM)
- **Trades Executed:** 3
- **Win Rate:** 100% (all profitable)
- **Scans Run:** 40+ automated scans
- **Context Window:** 80% usage (160k/200k)
