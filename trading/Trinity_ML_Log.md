### Trade #001 — ADA/USDT SHORT [OPEN]

**Entry Time:** 2026-02-22 11:31 AM NZT
**Status:** 🟡 OPEN

#### Setup Analysis
- **Confluence Score:** 6/10
- **Factors:** Daily bearish, 1H aligned, Near support
- **Entry Price:** $0.2804
- **Stop Loss:** $0.2817 (0.47% risk)
- **Take Profit:** $0.2777 (0.95% reward)
- **R:R Ratio:** 2.0
- **Position Size:** $200 (2% of $10,000)

#### Trade Rationale
Daily trend is bearish with 1H alignment confirming the direction. Price is near a support level, which could act as a bounce zone — but given the bearish momentum across timeframes, the probability of continuation is higher than reversal. The 15m setup triggered entry with reasonable confluence.

#### Risk Assessment
- Potential loss: $0.94 if stopped out
- Potential gain: $1.88 if target hit
- Key risk: Shorting into support could trigger bounce
