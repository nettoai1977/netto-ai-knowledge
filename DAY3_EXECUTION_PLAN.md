   - Estimated Time: 30 seconds

2. **Stage 2 (Orion):** Debugging and error analysis
   - Task: Deep error analysis, root cause investigation
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 minutes

3. **Stage 3 (Coder):** Code quality analysis
   - Task: Code quality assessment, style, best practices
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 minutes

4. **Stage 4 (Atlas):** Architectural review
   - Task: Architecture patterns, design principles, recommendations
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 minutes

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code passes through 4 specialists sequentially
- Each specialist contributes expertise
- Final consolidated report with all insights
- Time: 5-6 minutes (vs 15-20 min with single agent)
- Gain: 2.5-3x faster (plus higher quality)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All 4 stages execute sequentially
- [ ] Each specialist contributes analysis
- [ ] Handoffs successful
- [ ] Results consolidated
- [ ] Quality improved vs single agent

**Task 2: Test multi-agent pipeline (4 agents)**
- Impact: HIGH (3) - Validates 2.5-3x speedup + quality
- Urgency: MEDIUM (2) - Week 3 Day 3 (not blocking)
- Score: 5 → 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Task 3: Test peak load (10 tasks)**
- Impact: MEDIUM (2) - Validates system resilience
- Urgency: MEDIUM (2) - Week 3 Day 4 (later)
- Score: 4 → 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Task 4: Test coordination handoffs**
- Impact: MEDIUM (2) - Validates coordination protocols
- Urgency: LOW (1) - Improvement
- Score: 3 → 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

**Task 5: Test workflow automation integration**
- Impact: HIGH (3) - Validates cron automation
- Urgency: LOW (1) - Next week
- Score: 4 → 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
